## Overview

High-Performance Computing (HPC) has traditionally been limited to large enterprises, research labs, and government institutions. Despite growing demand from industries such as AI, energy, biomedical research, and manufacturing, small and mid-sized organizations face major barriers to adoption.

This project evaluates **Hoonify’s TurbOS platform** and proposes a **scalable strategy** to make HPC more accessible by reducing cost, operational complexity, and infrastructure friction.

## Problem Landscape

![SME HPC Pain Points](/hoonify/sme-pain-points.png)

Industry research and case studies reveal three dominant challenges for SMEs attempting to adopt HPC:

- High computational and infrastructure costs  
- Operational complexity involving cluster managers and multi-vendor hardware  
- Lack of specialized HPC deployment and optimization expertise

## TurbOS Legacy Bridge

![Legacy Bridge](/hoonify/legacy-bridge.png)

A key innovation proposed in this project is the **TurbOS Legacy Bridge**, designed to modernize and unlock decades of legacy HPC code:

- Auto-containerization of Fortran/C++ workloads  
- AI-assisted GPU acceleration (10×–100× speedups)  
- Zero-trust security wrapper for legacy software  

---

## Distribution Strategy
